# Scrolling-Window-in-C

It includes a scrolling input/output Window and a scrolling selection Menu Window you can use while creating projects in c/c++ for e.g: Library Database management program.

This is a tweak something i wanted when i was in 12th standard.
So developed this so that i can reshape my CBSE Library Database Project. Input/output window performs any input / output, and when screen goes small it becomes a scrolling window. The selection menu window provides a nice and clean way to produce a selection view.


#Scrolling input/output Window 

The practical application of this thing i will show you in my Library Database management program in new post. 
Here it does what
1. saves information that render in this window so that you can scroll and look back.
2. do output similar to cout object and use any manipulator function within and variables.
3. if overflow occurs words wrap up at the end and start from new line.
4. a special filter is included: ':' and  '[]'.
5. Last is input based functionality which is similar to GUI textbox you see. You can  supply fixed width input, automatic or an input with     validity check along with msgs to pop up if incorrect input (then reinput correctly).
6. Scrollbars when necessary.
7. Tab Switching support so that you can switch between multiple Scrolling input/output Windows or scrolling selection Menu Windows.
   You get an orange colored bordered layout whenever one window is active.
